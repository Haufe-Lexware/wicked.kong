# Kong Configuration

The two configuration files in this directory are currently **not used**. They are only kept here to know readily which environment variables can be used in e.g. a `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` file to override certain behaviour.

As of release `0.9.0` of Kong, the `kong.yml` is not used at all, but was superceded by the `kong.conf.default` file. Again: Neither are used in the build process.
